# MAUI_RatingView

MAUI_RatingView is a view to archive rating purposes in .NET MAUI.

Rating Control is commonly use in Mobile Apps, Games or any other services. However, .NET MAUI currently not having any related View/ Control so I decided to create a customizable rating control to ease my development process in the future.

## Customizable Property
+ TotalRating
+ CurrentValue
+ ItemSize
+ SelectedColor
+ UnselectedColor
+ RatingValueChanged (Event)

## Planning to Implement
+ [ ] Half Value Rating
